# Code Test

## Objective
Simple node api returning a paginated list of results.

## Assumptions
Even though this isn't being handled on the current state, the API assumes that the client is trusted with an API Key. 

## Notes
* Authentication and a few other security measures weren't implemented - no requirements for that.

## Stack
* nodejs
* expressjs
* mongo
* mongoose

## Credentials
You can use either a local instance of MongoDB to try this out or request me the credentials for the **mLab** database.
